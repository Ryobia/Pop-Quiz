# Pop-Quiz
## This was such a painful experience but I learned a lot.
  Specifically I learned about timers/setInterval and how to have a timer running over the whole program alongside other functions.
  I also learned about localStorage, I really didn't understand it before this and I'm still not super comfortable but I can use it now.
## This program's main purpose is to quiz the user on a few JS principles
  It records the users name and applies the score they recieve to their name on a scoreboard.
  Wrong answers are penalized and if the time runs out then they recieve a 0.
